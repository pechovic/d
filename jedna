To map a Windows shared folder from a Linux system via SMB (Server Message Block), you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages

Ensure that you have the necessary SMB client tools installed on your Linux system. On most Linux distributions, you can install these via the package manager:

For Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install cifs-utils

For RHEL/CentOS:

sudo yum install cifs-utils

For Arch Linux:

sudo pacman -S cifs-utils

2. Create a mount point

You will need a directory where the Windows share will be mounted. You can create this directory in any suitable location:

sudo mkdir /mnt/windows_share

3. Mount the SMB share

You can now mount the Windows SMB share using the mount.cifs command. Replace the following values with your specific details:

	•	//windows_server_ip_or_hostname/share_name: The network path of the Windows shared folder.
	•	/mnt/windows_share: The local mount point on your Linux system.
	•	username: The Windows username.
	•	password: The Windows password.

The basic mount command is:

sudo mount.cifs //windows_server_ip_or_hostname/share_name /mnt/windows_share -o username=windows_username,password=windows_password

For example:

sudo mount.cifs //192.168.1.10/shared_folder /mnt/windows_share -o username=JohnDoe,password=MyPassword

4. Mount with additional options (optional)

You can add more options depending on your needs:

	•	rw: Mount the share with read/write access.
	•	file_mode=0777 and dir_mode=0777: Set the file and directory permissions.
	•	uid=1000 and gid=1000: Set the user ID and group ID for file ownership.

Here’s an example with additional options:

sudo mount.cifs //192.168.1.10/shared_folder /mnt/windows_share -o username=JohnDoe,password=MyPassword,rw,uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777

5. Mount the share persistently (optional)

To automatically mount the SMB share at boot, you can add an entry to the /etc/fstab file.

First, open the /etc/fstab file in a text editor:

sudo nano /etc/fstab

Then, add the following line at the end, modifying it with your specific details:

//windows_server_ip_or_hostname/share_name /mnt/windows_share cifs username=JohnDoe,password=MyPassword,rw,uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0

This will automatically mount the Windows share each time the Linux system boots.

6. Unmount the share

To unmount the SMB share, use the following command:

sudo umount /mnt/windows_share

Troubleshooting

	•	Permission denied: Ensure the username and password are correct. Check if the Windows share has the correct permissions for the user.
	•	Mounting without password prompt: If you don’t want to include the password in the command or fstab, you can create a credentials file:
	1.	Create a file, e.g., /etc/smb-credentials:

sudo nano /etc/smb-credentials


	2.	Add the following content:

username=JohnDoe
password=MyPassword


	3.	Secure the file by restricting access to it:

sudo chmod 600 /etc/smb-credentials


	4.	Then, in your fstab or mount command, use the credentials option:

sudo mount.cifs //192.168.1.10/shared_folder /mnt/windows_share -o credentials=/etc/smb-credentials



This method keeps your password secure and out of visible command output.
