Certainly! Here's a simpler binary tree-related problem that focuses on a basic tree traversal technique, specifically **preorder traversal**. This problem is excellent for gauging a candidate's understanding of recursive methods and tree traversal concepts.

### Interview Question: Preorder Traversal of Binary Tree

**Problem Statement:**
Write a function that performs a preorder traversal of a binary tree and returns a list of values in the order they were visited. In preorder traversal, the nodes are visited in the order: Root, Left, Right.

**Background:**
Preorder traversal is a method of visiting all the nodes in a binary tree where each node is processed before either of its sub-trees. This is useful for creating a copy of the tree or for serializing the tree into a list or string format.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:**
```
     1
      \
       2
      /
     3
```
   **Output:** `[1, 2, 3]`
   **Explanation:** The root node (1) is visited first, then the right subtree of 1, which begins with 2, followed by the left child of 2, which is 3.

2. **Input:**
```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / 
 4  
```
   **Output:** `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
   **Explanation:** The traversal visits the nodes in the order of Root (1), then left to 2, then left to 4, and finally right to 3.

**Coding Requirements:**
- Define the class `TreeNode` to use for the binary tree nodes.
- Implement the function `PreorderTraversal(TreeNode root)` which will return a list of node values following the preorder traversal logic.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure the C# function:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class TreeNode
{
    public int val;
    public TreeNode left;
    public TreeNode right;

    public TreeNode(int x)
    {
        val = x;
    }
}

public class BinaryTree
{
    public List<int> PreorderTraversal(TreeNode root)
    {
        List<int> result = new List<int>();
        PreorderHelper(root, result);
        return result;
    }

    private void PreorderHelper(TreeNode node, List<int> result)
    {
        if (node == null)
            return;

        result.Add(node.val); // Visit the root
        PreorderHelper(node.left, result); // Traverse left subtree
        PreorderHelper(node.right, result); // Traverse right subtree
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        // Example usage
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1);
        root.right = new TreeNode(2);
        root.right.left = new TreeNode(3);

        BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree();
        List<int> traversalResult = tree.PreorderTraversal(root);
        Console.WriteLine("Preorder traversal: " + String.Join(", ", traversalResult));
    }
}
```

This C# implementation defines a `TreeNode` class for binary tree nodes and a `BinaryTree` class that includes a method for performing a preorder traversal. It uses a helper method to apply recursion for traversing the tree. The `Main` method constructs a small tree and prints the result of the traversal, demonstrating how the function works. This example covers fundamental concepts and provides a clear understanding of binary tree operations.
